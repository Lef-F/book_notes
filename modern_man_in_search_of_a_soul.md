# Modern Man In Search Of A Soul

Notes from C. G. Jung's book

## Chapter: Dream Analysis In Its Practical Application

Primitive people always take the phallus to mean the creative _mana_, the power of healing and fertility.

That which underlies all of these images (ancient imagery related to sexual acts) - and sexuality itself - is an archetypal content that is hard to grasp, and that finds its best psychological expression in the primitive _mana_ symbol.

## Chapter: Problems Of Modern Psychotherapy

The fact remains that the most thorough explanation leaves the patient in many cases an intelligent but still incapable child.
(Kinda like watching VSauce)


A hungry artist prefers bread to a beautiful painting, and a man in love prefers a woman to his public career...

	On average, those who easily achieve social adaptation and social position are better accounted for by the pleasure principle.

... yet the painting might be of the greatest importance to the one and public office to the other.

	On average, those who are unadapted social shortcomings leave them with a craving for power and importance.


[...] people whose passion is for self-assertion [...] are neurotic because they always imagine themselves oppressed [...] thus putting the goal they most desire quite out of reach.

Our world is so exceedingly rich in delusions that the truth is priceless and no one will let it slip because of few exceptions with which it cannot be brought into accord.

To be "normal" is a splendid ideal for the unsuccessful, for all those who have not yet found an adaptation. But for people who have far more ability than the average [...] restriction to the normal signifies [...] unbearable boredom, infernal sterility and hopelessness. 

[...] there are people who are neurotic because they cannot become normal [...] their deepest need is really to be able to lead "abnormal" lives.

A man can hope for satisfaction and fulfilment only in what he does not yet possess; he cannot find pleasure in something of which he has already had too much.

The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.

Who can enlighten his fellows when still in the dark about himself, and who can purify if he is himself unclean?

## Chapter: Aims Of Psychotherapy

_Note to self: Read this chapter again_

To paint what we see before us is a different matter from painting what we see within.

[The patient] strives to represent as fully as possible in his picture-series that which works within him, only to discover in the end that it is the eternally unknown and alien - the hidden foundations of psychic life.

We are dealing with a region of psychic life outside consciousness, and our way of observing it is indirect. As yet we do not know what depths we are trying to plumb.

## Chapter: A Psychologycal Theory Of Types

[Complexes] indicate the unresolved problems of the individual, the points at which he has suffered a defeat, at least for the time being, and where there is something he cannot evade or overcome - his weak spots in every sense of the word.

[...] the characteristics of the complex [...] arise from the clash between a requirement of adaptation and the individual's constitutional inability to meet the challenge.

The first form of the complex cannot be other than the parental complex, because the parents are the first reality with which the child comes into conflict.

Practical experience soon teaches us that the crux of the matter does not lie in the presence of a parental complex, but rather in the special way in which the complex works itself out in the life of the individual.

There are often several children who are exposed to the same influence, and yet each reacts to it in a totally different way.

Whatever we look at, and however we look at it, we only see through our own eyes.

The individual merely offers his contribution, and in this sense do I only dare to speak of my way of seeing things.

When I speak of "thinking", it is only the philosopher who does not know what I mean; no layman will find it incomprehensible.

Speach is a storehouse of images founded on experience, and therefore concepts which are too abstract do not easily take root in it.

Lack of rationality is a vice where thinking and feeling are called for - rationality is a vice where sensation and intuition should be trusted.

[the] lack of self-sufficiency, and our resulting dependence on people and circumstances [... tends] to make us suggestible.

[...] everyone is in love with his own ideas.

## Chapter: The Stages Of Life

[... in regards to problems in the human development ...] there will be much to which we must add a question-mark in our thoughts. And - worse still - there will be some things which we must accept on faith, while **now and then we must even indulge in speculations**.

Our psychic processes are made up to a large extent of reflections doubts and experiments, all of which are almost completely foreign [to the] primitive man.

If the individual is sufficiently well prepared, the transition to a professional career may take place smoothly. But if he clings to illusions that contradict reality, then problems will surely arise.

It seems as if young people who have had to struggle hard for their existence are spared inner problems, while those for whom adaptation was made easy run into problems of sex or conflicts growing from a sense of inferiority.

[...] the neurotic is ill because he is unconscious of his problems; while the man with a difficult tamperament suffers from his conscious problems without being ill. 

[...] rebirth rituals of primitive races, is to transform a human being into a new - a future - man, and to allow the old forms of life to die away.

Psychology teaches us that, in a certain sense, there is nothing in the psyche that is old; nothing can really, definitely die away.

[...] society does not value these feats [higher levels of consciousness] of the psyche very highly; its prizes are always given for achievement and not for presonality - the latter being rewarded, for the most part, posthymously.

The death of the father has the effect of an overhurried - an almost catastrophic - ripening.

Who does not know those touching old gentlemen who must always warm up the dish of their student days, who can fan the flames of life only my reminiscences of their heroic youth - and who for the rest, are stuck in a hopelessly wooden philistinism?

The neurotic is rather a person who can never have things as he would like them in the present, and who can therefore never enjoy the past.

_Si jeunesse savait, si vieillesse pouvait_

[...] one can observe women in these self-same business spheres which have developed in the second half of life an uncommon masculinity and insiciveness which pushes the feelings and the heart aside. Very often this reversal is accompanied by all sorts of catastrophies in marriage.

After having lashed its light upon the world, the sun withdraws its rays in order to illuminate itself. Instead of doing likewise, many old people prefer to be hypochondriacs, niggards, doctrinaires, applauders of the past or eternal adolescents - all lamentable substitutes for the illumination of the self, but inevitable consequences of the delusion that the second half of life must be governed by the principles of the first.

Culture lies beyond the purpose of nature. Could by any chance culture be the purpose an meaning of the second half of life?

In the United States it is almost an ideal for the father to be the brother of his sons, and for the mother if possible to be the younger sister of her daughter.

But we must not forget that only a very few people are aritsts in life; that the art of life is the most distinguished and rarest of all the arts.
